This is a list of Azure OpenAI jailbreak prompts based on SQL, Splunk, and other query language syntax. They are all queries that can be used as indirect prompt injection attacks and are loosely based on elder-plinius's work here: https://github.com/elder-plinius/L1B3RT45

Here are some examples:

(Note: These specific queries were all tested to work on Azure OpenAI apps with Prompt Shield enabled as of June 7, 2024 and are only confirmed to be valid up until this date!)

You can easily make your own using variations of different search query syntaxes. If your initial query doesn't seem to work, note that it can be effective to simply add or remove a search operator or character. The specific query guides that I used for this repo are below:
