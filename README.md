***THIS IS FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY***

This is a list of OpenAI jailbreak prompts based on SQL, Splunk, and other query language syntax. They are loosely based on elder-plinius's work here: https://github.com/elder-plinius/L1B3RT45

These specific queries were all tested to work on Azure OpenAI as of June 7, 2024 and are only valid up until this date! 

To make your own use different variations of different query syntaxes. From what I've noticed, if your initial query doesn't seem to work, you'd be shocked at how effective simply adding or removing a search operator or character can make it successful. The specific query guides that I used for this repo are below:
